# Use AI or it'll use you!

So, out of all artificial intelligent conversations, what I hear the most is *will it take jobs,* or *it will take jobs.* Yes, AI will take jobs, but I believe it'll be the jobs of those *not* using AI. While I'm not immune and also not trying to proceed biasedly, it's trivial to me in the usage of where AI belongs in my daily Life.

There are several times I go to AI for summaries or quick History searches, with a little spice. "Top 10 songs with a Halloween story." Crazy, but AI can put together something, even if it's a little off - and with tuning, it can become even better.

I can train AI on projects, and then draft policies for me to add human touch to, or outright correct (because it may be heading in the wrong direction or misunderstand completely) bits as I go on. And this is exactly my point, in a secretarial manner, AI has helped progress a lot of my projects, and I firmly believe I wouldn't have the outside of the box thinking as I do now if I didn't use it - sure, I could talk with people, and I do, but AI offers a pressing feature: Privacy

Providing you have the resources (hardware) to do so, you may run models "offline" or on your network to compute privacy focused tasks - and I take great advantage of this. Yes, it doesn't have real-time information, but it has *enough* information, and if you're aware of its shortage of information you can fill in the blanks, and or update it as you go with new bits.

If you're interested, here is a Github link: [nomic-ai/gpt4all: GPT4All: Chat with Local LLMs on Any Device (github.com)](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all)

Don't hesitate to reach out for guidance to launch the program. Keep in mind your computer must have at least 16 GB of RAM, and a moderately recent CPU (se, 2019 and onwards) to make effective use of it. There *are* setups to run on tiny devices such as Raspberry Pi, but I am unfamiliar with those.

A chatter pointed out open-source software to help with subtitling and I have yet to explore the Raspberry Pi method.

## We're likely better off fusing with technology

Back to 2008 for a short minute: I was the privacy nut. The kid you didn't want to discuss privacy with because I'd go off on many subjects, going against many companies--sometimes with little insight as to *why* something may have been executed the way it was - of course! I was young and naïve. and I'm still naïve, but with more experience.

I'd push the mission of not using smartphones for everything, not using payments on smartphones, and not using cards in general, especially tied to smartphones - and some of this changed in incredible ways, for me anyway. You'll rarely see me *not* using my smartphone to checkout with Apple Pay or tap to pay.

Not to bore you too much, but I should include some back History here for you to understand how I've changed some of my opinions. It's only fair.

**My view of the web in 2010**:

> *Title: # [How the Web Works and How it Could Work](https://snick512.wordpress.com/2010/12/29/how-the-web-works-and-how-it-could-work/)*
> 
> *Forever web pages have been improving. Don’t say they haven’t either. Remember messy ol’ HTML? Now there’s CSS to go with that, and Javascript too.*
> 
> *The traditional sense in going to a webstie is you load it, and click on links – It’s just that simple. What if this was a little more complex, but still easy?*
> 
> *Imagine a web page that could be organised in any manner according to the person behind the browser. No specific edits, no specific alignments, no specific anything. One could add pictures, video, music, and share these edits with their friends. More-so these edits would automatically be visible to anyone who was “following.” Is this confusing? I hope not. Just think of it as a Status / Twitter on steroids. A way for people to manipulate web pages as they see fit.*
> 
> *I would assume that every web page would look normal – But would then be manipulated by each visitor (if they wanted to). Of course these edits would be locked to said user.*
> 
> *In-depth*
> 
> *If you’ve ever used Google Docs, or Etherpad, you should understand exactly where I’m going with this. Multiple people could edit a page, and have a deeper interaction with the website/online service. Eh? Sure, a comments box, Social buttons, and so on aren’t bad. (But) What if these changes stuck, and could be de/centralised as needed. Similar to the diaspora model, ‘cept a little more intense.*

> *Though I could be jumping the line here. Maybe the web isn’t ready for a such thing, yet. Wh*o knows.

### and a small step into what I believe about Privacy

We should be afforded individual privacy, and this layer should encompass these spots (and more, but don't take this concrete, I'm just flying my thoughts here):

- Right to disconnect
  
- Right to be forgotten
  
- Non-intrusive DRM, and outright no DRM
  

Digital Rights Management is naturally a thorn in privacy due to its call home aspects. If you're on Windows Media Player or iTunes, the service must occasionally dial home to see if you're "allowed" to play the requested files. The same rings true for video games - there are certain games refusing to play offline without first checking on Internet connectivity and licensing, despite the individual only wanting to play offline.

This is another reason disc-less systems are a bad idea. It erodes tangible copies from being used and makes the user dependent on DRM completely.

After awhile, services start to learn when you're awake, as a very tiny example. Imagine AI calculating your schedule.

## Bringing it together

Kinda confusing but bringing it together; We are likely better off fusing with technology in a privacy-first manner. Meaning, anything to do with AI should always be executed with the individual's privacy in mind. We can surely have a wonderful time on the Internet, and with technology but I don't believe it'll be possible if it's not checked in regard to privacy.

Thoughts on future use is artificial intelligence will become more accessible to the everyday person *without* third party service, and I don't believe it'll be effective until then.

AI is still expensive, financially and privacy wise.

I believe you should become aware of AI and learn how to make use of it to help understand how it's using your data, and how you can use it to better your own Life.

I want the web to be fun and free and use all its fruits, but we need to take grip of it now before we don't know how to.

Be safe and thank you for reading!
